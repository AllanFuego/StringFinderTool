**Hello Guys...
Its Allan_Fuego here again with a creative tool.**

As i am a android/mobile modder mostly i think that if i also have a power like dnspy to search something and it would have shown everything related to it and finally literally after 3 hours üò∂ i am doneüòÖüòÇüòÇ
I created a Tool that will help you search all occurence of a particular string in any file.
The Tool is created in java and you can easily use it from android 6 to android 13.
Below android 10 users can directly use by allowing inapp permission while android 10 and above users have to manually activate all file permission for it by going to settings‚úÖ

**Now lets talk about the tool features..
->It can find all occurences of a string.
->The search is case in-sensitive,means you can write the search word in any way you like like in upper or lower class and still it would find all strings.
->You can copy the search results and paste it in a separate text file and find your required strings.‚úÖ**

***Thats it about the tool.Below i am posting a short video of how to use it.
Enjoy Modding Everyoneü•∞‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è***
